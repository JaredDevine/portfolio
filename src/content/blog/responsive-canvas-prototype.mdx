title: Responsive Canvas Prototype
description:
  "In this project I worked on turning a responsive canvas design into a fully
  interactive prototype that lets users tweak and resize sections on the fly. My
  coding focused on adding a pattern for new charts and ensuring everything
  stayed responsive. The prototype turned out great, meeting all the
  requirements and showcasing our team's ability to collaborate effectively. It
  hit the mark with its smart, adjustable features and responsive design."

### Objective

The objective of the project was to transform a responsive canvas design concept
into a live code interactive prototype and proof of concept for developers.

### Background

The canvas design concept needed to be equipped with a repeatable pattern for
adding new charts and graphs, and the individual canvas sections needed to be
resizable and responsive.

### Solution

To achieve the objective, the prototype was developed to allow users to adjust
the size of the vertical and horizontal dividers that separate each section of
the canvas. The vertical dividers were made to snap to a grid, while the
horizontal dividers were fluid. Additionally, the entire canvas was fluid, which
meant that when resized, all items on the canvas automatically adjusted their
size and accordingly. The project was successfully completed, and the prototype
was fully interactive and responsive.

### My Contribution

As part of this project, my contribution was to code the interactive prototype
(HTML, CSS, JS) and ensure that it met all of the necessary requirements.
Specifically, I was responsible for creating the repeatable pattern for adding
new charts and graphs to the canvas, as well as making sure that the canvas
sections were resizable and responsive. Additionally, I collaborated with the
design team to ensure that the prototype closely matched the original canvas
design concept. Overall, I am proud of the work that I completed on this
project, and I believe that the final prototype is an excellent representation
of the challenges I can overcome with my front-end development skills.

### Results

The interactive prototype successfully achieved the objective of transforming
the responsive canvas design concept into a live code prototype. The repeatable
pattern for adding new charts and graphs was implemented, and the individual
canvas sections were resizable and responsive. Users could adjust the size of
the vertical and horizontal dividers that separate each section of the canvas,
and the entire canvas was fluid, adjusting automatically when resized. The
prototype was fully interactive and responsive, and it closely matched the
original canvas design concept.

The project was completed on time and met all of the necessary requirements. The
collaboration between the development and design teams was successful, and the
final product was of high quality.

#### Senior UX Designer Testimonial

The responsive canvas work you did was instrumental in communicating the
interactions to our stakeholders. Your work made it easy to show the drag and
drop interactions as well as the resizing of the zones, as well as supporting
the overall intent of responsive canvas. Although the work you did was extremely
complex, you worked quickly in getting the proof of concept together. In
addition, you were proactive and passionate while working on this project.
