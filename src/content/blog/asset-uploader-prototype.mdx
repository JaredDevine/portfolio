### Objective

The objective of this project was to create an interactive asset loader
prototype that would reveal different dropzone areas on the screen when an asset
was dragged into the browser.

### Background

The project was completed with the aim of improving the user experience by
making it easy to load content by dragging assets into the browser. The project
required coding and animation skills to deliver a polished and elegant
prototype.

### Solution

To achieve the desired outcome, the project involved creating a drag and drop
interaction that would reveal different dropzone areas on the screen when an
asset was dragged into the browser. Depending where on screen the asset was
dragged, different areas were revealed, making it easy to load content. The use
of animations added to the elegance and sophistication of the interaction,
resulting in a successful prototype that was well-received by stakeholders.

the design concept and coding the interactive prototype. I worked closely with
the design team to ensure that the loader interaction was seamlessly executed
and met the project objectives. My skills in design, front-end development, and
animation, were instrumental in the successful delivery of the project.
