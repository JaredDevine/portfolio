### Objective

To improve the data analysis and visualization experience for dashboard creators
and consumers by introducing the Natural Language Insights feature in IBM Cognos
Analytics 11.2.4.

### Background

Prior to the release of IBM Cognos Analytics 11.2.4, dashboard creators had to
manually identify and communicate meaningful insights and trends in their data
to other users. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors, as it
required the dashboard creator to constantly update insights as the data
changed.

### Solution

IBM Cognos Analytics 11.2.4 introduced the Natural Language Insights feature,
which automatically generates insights based on the data in a visualization.
These insights are presented in natural language and can use data from outside
the visualization to draw conclusions and highlight key drivers or underlying
causes. Dashboard creators can mark their favourite insights and choose the
order in which they are displayed to other users. Consumers can see these
favourited insights as well as up to three additional insights suggested by
Cognos Analytics.

### My Contribution

As a bridge between design and development, I played a pivotal role in the
enhancement of our project by focusing on user-centric design principles and
seamless integration with development. I began by creating sketches for
Narrative Insight Cards to provide foundational visual concepts and facilitate
initial design discussions. From there, I developed screen designs based on user
stories to ensure our solutions aligned closely with user needs and
expectations. Further refining our approach, I created high-fidelity designs and
flows, focusing on delivering a polished and intuitive user interface.

Throughout the project, I led multiple design meetings with cross-discipline
stakeholders, ensuring that every aspect of the design met the needs and
expectations of both the creators and consumers of the dashboard. My advisory
role extended to addressing accessibility, ensuring that the product was usable
by people with a wide range of abilities, and overcoming various UI challenges
to improve usability and aesthetics. Additionally, I designed and developed a
prototype of intended interactions specifically for developers, which served as
a practical guide to aid in accurate implementation and helped bridge the gap
between design intent and technical execution.

I worked closely with the development team throughout the process, providing
guidance and feedback to ensure that the feature was intuitive and easy to use.
This collaborative effort significantly enhanced the project's effectiveness and
user satisfaction.

### Results

The Natural Language Insights feature has greatly improved the data analysis and
visualization experience for both dashboard creators and consumers. Dashboard
creators can now easily visualize and share insights with other users, saving
time and reducing the risk of errors. Consumers can easily access and understand
the insights presented by the dashboard creator, ensuring consistency in
information sharing and highlighting the most important points. Overall, the
Natural Language Insights feature has significantly enhanced the effectiveness
and efficiency of data analysis and visualization in IBM Cognos Analytics.

Jared, thank you for the extra effort you put in during the CNS development
cycle. The collaboration between you and Victor was exceptional and allowed us
to cut our turn around time drastically, ensuring we have a very clean and
successful offering for our users. Your designs, as well as your ability to
listen, accept feedback, and pivot on the fly has made for a great collaborative
project. Amazing work!

#### Software Developer Testimonial

It was a pleasure working with you on the CNS project. I look forward to phase 2
and the new challenges ahead. For phase 1 of the CNS project, I would like to
applaud your attention to design details. There were a lot of ideas that were
brought up in terms of delivering the best user experience. Most of the ideas
were tested out and made it to production and for the few that didnâ€™t, we
learned valuable lessons there. I like how you tackled problems head-on! You
clearly showed initiative by suggesting some solutions to some development
problems, for example, the scrolling issue.

You were very proactive in setting up meetings to identify issues before the
broader team caught on. This accelerated development to fix problems.
