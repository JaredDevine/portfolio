### Curation is Creation

Before the AI boom, I experimented with generative art using a simple method
that combined random SVG shapes and colors to create unique compositions. The
process was a blend of chaos and control, where I set the parameters and let the
code do the rest. The results were unpredictable and often surprising, leading
to a collection of digital art pieces that were both abstract and visually
engaging. This front-end experiment opened my eyes to the possibilities of what
can be created using a simple html canvas and SVG shapes.
