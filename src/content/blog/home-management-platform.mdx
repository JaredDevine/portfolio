### Objective

To develop a digital platform that enhances homeowners' ability to manage,
maintain, and financially plan for their home ownership responsibilities
effectively, minimizing unexpected costs and maximizing the lifespan of home
systems and appliances.

### Background

Homeowners often face the challenge of unexpected home maintenance costs and the
complexity of managing various home-related expenses. Metronome was
conceptualized to address these issues by providing predictive insights,
maintenance scheduling, and financial oversight through an accessible digital
interface.

### Solution

Metronome integrates advanced predictive analytics to forecast necessary
maintenance and replacements, offers tailored recommendations to improve home
health, and provides a centralized platform for monitoring significant expenses
and savings opportunities. This solution aims to transform how homeowners
interact with and manage their properties, making it a proactive rather than
reactive experience.

### My Contribution

As the Product Designer and Front-End Developer for Metronome, I led the design
and implementation of the user interface. I created comprehensive designs and
prototypes using Figma, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
Subsequently, I developed the front-end architecture using React, styled with
Tailwind CSS for a responsive design, and incorporated animations with Framer
Motion to enhance visual engagement and user interaction.

#### CTO Testimonial

Jared was responsible for the UI/UX design of our product from the ground up.
Starting with just a logo and a concept, he played a pivotal role in
transforming it into a beautiful, functional product now live in the market. He
was instrumental in designing and building key features such as the homeowner,
landlord, and buyer dashboards, as well as the customer onboarding experience.
Jared wore multiple hatsâ€”some days he was our design champion, and on others, he
worked as a front-end engineer. He consistently demonstrated an ability to
quickly pick up new skills and adapt to the needs of the project. As a core team
member, Jared was crucial to the successful launch of our product.
